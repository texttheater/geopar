Possible Projects
=================

* acquire the lexicon automatically rather than specifying it manually
* add more features to the parser
* replace/complement features with deep neural nets
* study on how well different lexicon styles work, e.g., which entry is better?
  `how many := count(_, _, _)` or `many := count(_, _, _)`?
* â€¦
